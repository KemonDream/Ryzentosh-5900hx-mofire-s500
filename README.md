# Ryzentosh-5900hx-mofire-s500
anything impossible hardware are used in this little cube. And the goal is to make it same as apple's
 Hardware: 
  cpu:5900hx-es
  gpu:vega8-es
  ethernet:realtek
  wireless:ax210 200 bcm94360(for test)
  motherboard:demo board
  others:two m.2 slot. 2xusb3.0 4xusb2.0 1xdp 1xhdmi; monitor using dp direct conneted b160qan02.q
 OS:
  MacOS13.4.1 Ventura
  OpenCore 0.9.0 & 0.9.3

 Progress:
 all things worked but wifi was not. So as airdrop and things depents on it will not be ok.
 monitor refreshrate is 165hz, have no clues to trun that on.
 Knowing issues:
  wireless wifi was impossiable to be driven till now. I've tested ax200 ax210 &bcm94360(should be native in os13 but only bluetooth working).
  I have seached the internet, while some had the same issue that wifi work in intel based hackintosh thongh not functioning in ryzentosh and none of them solved directly.
