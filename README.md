# Ryzentosh-5900hx-mofire-s500
 -Anything impossible hardware are used in this little cube. And the goal is to make it same as Apple's\
 -If you like this project and want to download the EFI, please let me know \
**Hardware**:
- cpu:5900hx-es
- gpu:vega8-es
- network:realtek
- wireless:-wifislot bcm94360ng(airdrop) ax210 200 (test)
- motherboard:demo board (lookup amd b550 motherboard)
- others:two m.2 slot. 2xusb3.0 4xusb2.0 1xDP 1xHDMI; Monitor using dp-direct-connetted b160qan02.q
- newbought: rx6600xt some acpi and changes in device tab
           \
**OS**:
- MacOS Ventura(tested 13.3-13.5.1) Sonoma14.1(with Opencore lagacy installer)
- OpenCore 0.9.0 & 0.9.3

 # Progress:
 - all things worked so as airdrop.
 - Fixed wifi slot dsdt issues so wifi is finally working (took me 2 months to figure it out) 
 - monitor enabled hidpi and 165hz with hidpi.sh
 - Trying to fix ramdom system-inresponse or rebooting issues for several months
 - Tryied newest Os,that is Sonoma, install on a different apfs volume. I managend to get all things worked
 # Knowing issues:
  - can't use pbo for amd cpu as it can crash down the os. This is a mess for my work.\
    fixï¼šdisable curve optimize in bios setting
  - operating sys encounter black screen sometimes when booting up\
    fix: also related PBO, method same as above 
  - system sometimes stuck and must force to reboot and threw panic.(predicted to be nootred issues while no hardware failure in panelty test)\
    fix1: also PBO or--the mini pc only have a positive fan for cpu cooling so that the memory cooling is not enough with just passive cooling.You should try adding some stuff to cool the memory. (My way to fix is add a some thermal conductivities to transfur the heat to the metal shell and a small-low-rpm-no-noise-side-blowing fan will bring heat away!)
    fix2: (constucting)cpu watchdog switch to "no error",and internal time 21s. The hackintosh can run about half a month with no rebooting.
  - power bottom can not function
